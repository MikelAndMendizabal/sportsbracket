# sportsbracket assignment
On this issignment you may find a generic directive "sports-bracket".When called, the directive displays the games, teams and kickoff.
## Build & development

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. No special test has been programed.

## Notes
Due to time restriction issues this project is unfinished. Next steps would have been styling the layout, so the bracket displays the games in two
opposite trees. 
It would follow a responsive design where it turns into a list when screen size <1024px.
Finally a production version can be found under dist folder, with minified scripts.
